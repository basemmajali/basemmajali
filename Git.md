## Git Commands

Here are some of the most important Git commands you might find useful during your development process:

1. **Initialize a Repository**: To start version controlling your project, you can use the following command:

   ```
   git init
   ```

2. **Clone a Repository**: If you want to work on an existing project, you can clone it with:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **Check Status**: To see the status of your working directory and staging area, use:

   ```
   git status
   ```

4. **Add Files to Staging Area**: Before committing changes, you need to add them to the staging area using:

   ```
   git add <file_name>
   ```

   or to add all changes:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**: Once your changes are staged, commit them to the repository with a descriptive message:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

6. **Pull Changes**: If you're working in a team, you may need to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository:

   ```
   git pull origin <branch_name>
   ```

7. **Push Changes**: To send your committed changes to the remote repository, use:

   ```
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

8. **Create a New Branch**: To create a new branch for developing a new feature or fixing a bug:

   ```
   git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
   ```

9. **Switch Branches**: To switch between branches:

   ```
   git checkout <branch_name>
   ```

10. **Merge Branches**: To merge a branch into the current branch:

    ```
    git merge <branch_name>
    ```

11. **View Commit History**: To see the commit history and their details:

    ```
    git log
    ```

12. **Discard Local Changes**: To discard changes in your working directory:

    ```
    git checkout -- <file_name>
    ```

13. **Undo the Last Commit**: To undo the last commit but keep changes in the working directory:

    ```
    git reset HEAD~1
    ```

14. **Configure User Information**: Set up your user information (name and email):

    ```
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```

15. **Resolve Merge Conflicts**: If conflicts occur during a merge, manually resolve them and commit the changes.

Remember to replace `<repository_url>` and `<branch_name>` with the appropriate values for your project.
